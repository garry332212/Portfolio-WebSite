          I started my Bachelor Degree in 2018, at A.U.T. I have learned Java, C
          programming, Javascript, PHP and MERN during my time at the campus. I
          have also participated in team projects, learnd about project
          managment and how to be a project leader as well. Now that i graduated
          from university i am looking to take my current skills to the next
          level. After Graduation i started working on React.js on my own with
          the help of youtube tutorials and some courses from UDEMY.

          I am very enthusiastic about Web Development. React is my favourite
          Javascript library This Portfolio Website itself was created using
          React.js and Tailwind CSS. I found React so much better to create Web
          Application due to reusability. I â™¥ creating React.js projects however
          i have also created projects in Java, PHP, Javascript and MERN duiring
          my bachelor degree.{" "}
